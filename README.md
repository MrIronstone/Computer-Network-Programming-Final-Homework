# Computer-Network-Programming-Final-Homework

Homework Purpose:

Within the scope of the assignment, it is aimed to learn and use "TCP/IP Socket Programming" and related structures/protocols.

Homework Instruction Rules:

IR_1: The game will be played between two PCs (Two users - Server/Client architecture).\
IR_2: Both players will sew 5 own flags on their own copies of the same map (seen below).\
IR_3: Flag coordinates will not be shared between players.\
IR_4: A flag represents a certain area. (Example: area of 15 pixels x 15 pixels.)\
IR_5: Both players will try to find their respective flags. Finds the flag of the opposing player will be the owner/manager of that region.\
IR_6: The positions of the flags will remain fixed during the game.

Mat_1: TCP Protocol structure will be used.\
Mat_2: In the software on both PCs, the attached map will be used as a visual map for planting flags.\
Mat_3: C# language on Windows / Mono on Linux can be used.\
Mat_4: The data structures to be used are left flexible for the developerâ€™s choice.
